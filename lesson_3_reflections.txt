When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
  When you want to share your work, potentially work from another computer, 
  ensure changes are saved in another platform 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So you're pulling at the right times, similar to why you might want to 
	commit changes manually within a branch

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?
	fork: clone on github
	clone: essentially copying the entirety of a file including its history
	branch: a diverted version/addition to a program that doesn't affect
	other versions.
	You fork a program to work on your own version without altering the 
	original but while still providing credit to the original. You clone
	in order to work on said program with your own programs on your computer
	and you use branches to maintain a working, presentable version of your 
	code while experimenting with changes
