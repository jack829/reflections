What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	so that you can start using version control with git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The working directory holds the commits that are the combined elements 
	from the staging area at a certain period. The repository holds all of
	these elements at any given time
	This allows you to stage related files and commit them together so they
	will show up under the same commit which streamlines the everything when
	you look through the history
